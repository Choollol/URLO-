**How to Use**

Download the zip folder, extract it, and move it somewhere permanent. In the same folder as urlo.exe, create text files that contain the URLs you want to open, each URL on a separate line. 
The names of the text files are how they are identified and displayed in the program, so it is recommended to name each file something descriptive.

Creating a shortcut on the desktop or taskbar for easy access is also recommended.
